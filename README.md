## python-api-challenge
This project includes two parts: WeatherPy and VacationPy, which provide data analysis and visualization based on weather and hotel
 data.

# Prerequisites
Before running the code, you'll need to make sure you have the following prerequisites:

# For WeatherPy:
    . Python 3 installed on your machine.
    . Jupyter Notebook or a code editor that supports Jupyter notebooks.
    . API key for the OpenWeatherMap API. You can obtain one by signing up at OpenWeatherMap.
    . Required Python libraries (matplotlib, pandas, numpy, requests, scipy, citipy).
# For VacationPy:
    . Python 3 installed on your machine.
    . Jupyter Notebook or a code editor that supports Jupyter notebooks.
    . API key for the Geoapify API. You can obtain one by signing up at Geoapify.
    . Required Python libraries (hvplot, geoviews, holoviews, pandas, requests).
    . Make sure you have installed the required Python libraries, and your API keys are available for use in the code.

# How the Code Runs
    The project consists of two parts, WeatherPy and VacationPy:

## WeatherPy:
    In this section, WeatherPy analyzes weather data for a list of randomly generated cities. The data is retrieved using the OpenWeatherMap API. Various weather variables such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed are analyzed in relation to latitude. Here's how the code runs:

    # Random City Generation:
       . A list of random cities is generated using the citipy library based on latitude and longitude coordinates.

    # Data Retrieval:
        . Weather data for these cities is retrieved using the OpenWeatherMap API. The code loops through the city list and makes API requests for each city.

    # Data Analysis:
        . The retrieved data is processed and stored in a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
        . Scatter plots are created to showcase the relationships between weather variables and latitude.
    # Linear Regression:
        . Linear regression is applied to each relationship, providing an r-value (correlation coefficient) for each plot.

## VacationPy
    In the VacationPy section, the focus is on finding hotels near cities that meet specific weather conditions and displaying them on a map. Here's how the code runs:

    # Humidity Heatmap:
        . A heatmap is created using the hvplot library to display cities with points based on their humidity. The size of each point corresponds to the humidity level.

    # Filtering Ideal Weather Conditions:
        . Cities that meet specific weather criteria (temperature range and cloudiness) are filtered from the dataset.

    # Finding Hotels:
        . The Geoapify API is used to find the nearest hotel within 10,000 meters of each city's coordinates.
        . The hotel information is added to the DataFrame.

    # Hotel Map:
        . A map is created to display the locations of the selected cities with hotels.
        . The hotel names are included in the hover information.

The code provided in each section demonstrates how to conduct this analysis and visualization, making it a useful template for similar projects. You can run each section separately in a Jupyter Notebook or code editor.
